All LSVR widgets and shortcodes now support templates, which means you can easily override their frontend code via a child theme. Simply copy the original widget/shortcode template file to your child theme and edit its code there. Each template has to be saved under a correct folder in your child theme folder.

For widgets:
[plugin-folder-name]/templates/widgets/[widget-template-file]

For shortcodes:
[plugin-folder-name]/templates/shortcodes/[shortcode-template-file]

For example, if you want to override code for the LSVR Featured Post widget, open wp-content/plugins/lsvr-elements/templates/widgets folder and copy post-featured.php file into your child theme folder under lsvr-elements/templates/widgets folder.

------------------------------

v2.4.0

The theme is now fully optimized for the new Gutenberg block editor (the native content editor in WordPress 5.0). We HIGHLY recommend to update to WordPress 5.0 and switch your content to Gutenberg as soon as possible. If you are not ready yet, then install the Classic Editor plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) and go to Appearance / Customize / Misc and enable "Gutenberg Is Disabled" option (don't forget to turn it off once you switch to Gutenberg).

Please note that if you've already built pages in Gutenberg with the previous version, all TownPress and LSVR blocks will have to be re-inserted once you update to this newest version.

If you are not using the Gutenberg editor, you may notice that position of some metaboxes (for example Sidebar Settings) have changed. Simply drag and drop them to the old position (or any other position you like).

If you are using the default (red) predefined color scheme, then once you update go to Appearance / Customize / Colors, make sure the "Choose Predefined Skin" is set to "Default" and save your settings. If you are having any issues with the color scheme, try to switch to any other scheme, save it and then switch back to "Default" and save it again.

Locating directory listings on map via address method should now be more reliable (make sure to check your Google Maps API settings under your Google account).

Since the Gutenberg block editor is now the preferred content editor, the WPBakery Page Builder is no more included within the installable townpress.zip file. The WPBakery Page Builder is still supported though and you will find its installation .zip in the full package which you can download from your ThemeForest account (unzip it and go to Plugins folder where you will find js_composer.zip).

Updated the demo data - please note that posts and pages demo data were created using the Gutenberg. Old (WPBakery Page Builder based) demo data is provided as well, you will find it in the full package / Legacy / VC demo data.

The old version of the theme (TownPress 1.x) installation file was moved to Legacy / TownPress v1 folder in the full package.

------------------------------

v2.3.0

Added support for new Gutenberg editor. Only standard posts and regular pages are currently supported though. All TownPress and LSVR elements available in WPBakery Page Builder are now available in Gutenberg editor as well. Please note that since the WordPress 5.0 (which will include Gutenberg in the core) is still not released and the Gutenberg plugin itself is still under constant development, consider this functionality to be in a beta. The WPBakery Page Builder is still a preferred method to built your pages.

Added LSVR Elements plugin which contains bunch of new widgets and shortcodes:
LSVR Definition List widget
LSVR Featured Post widget
LSVR Posts widget
LSVR Alert Message shortcode
LSVR Counter shortcode
LSVR Definition List Widget shortcode
LSVR Feature shortcode
LSVR Featured Post Widget shortcode
LSVR Posts Widget shortcode
LSVR Progress Bar shortcode
lsvr_icon shortcode
All shortcodes (except lsvr_icon) are available as elements in both the WPBakery Page Builder and new Gutenberg editor.

TownPress Posts widget, TownPress Featured Post widget, TownPress Post List Widget shortcode and lsvr_townpress_icon shortcode are now DEPRECATED and will be removed in the future updates. Please use LSVR Posts widget, LSVR Featured Post widget, LSVR Posts Widget shortcode and lsvr_icon shortcode instead.

Added an error message for the listing post to display any potential error returned from the Google API when you are saving the listing and using the Exact Address option. Please note, that since the recent updates to the Google API, your old API keys may not work anymore. However, using the latitude and longitude options instead of the exact address is the most safest way to locate your listings on the map.

------------------------------

v2.0.0

This update is basically a brand new theme with the original TownPress design. There is probably not a single file or feature which has not been changed, so let's list only some of the most notable new features:

- listing directory functionality with the map
- recurring events
- document posts can now contain multiple file attachments
- person directory
- main theme settings can be now managed via WordPress Customizer
- all custom post types (listings, events, galleries, notices, people) come in a form of separate plugin so you can install only the ones you want to use to avoid unnecessary bloating
- much cleaner code for easier customization for developers

IMPORTANT - the 2.0 version is NOT compatible with 1.x version. Proceed very carefully if you are updating from TownPress 1.x. It is highly recommended to do a clean install instead.

The most recent 1.x version can be found in the full package (in "Old Version" folder). It is supposed to be a backup for existing 1.x users and it also may be updated in the future in case of fixing any critical bugs in 1.x. If you are a new TownPress user, DO NOT install the 1.x version as it is no longer supported. I will still provide support for 1.x users who bought the theme before 2.0 release and have a valid support.

------------------------------

v1.6.0

TownPress 2.0 beta version was added to the full package. You can download the full package under your ThemeForest account / Downloads. You will find the installable .zip file in the "Beta" folder once you unzip the full package archive.

Better compatibility with 3rd party plugins - this fix required change of almost all default .php files in theme's root. So if you are using Child Theme where you are overriding any of those .php files, please copy them from Parent theme and make your changes again. Basically, the DIV with ID "core" and DIV with class "c-container" were moved from default files like index.php, page.php, 404.php, search.php and all "archive-" and "single-" .php into header.php and footer.php. Please see the complete changelog for list of all affected files. If you are not using Child theme or you've never copied any .php file from Parent theme to your Child theme, just ignore this message.

Updated Articles element so you can highlight more than just first post - please check your settings for this element
